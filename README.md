# Leetcode submissions 📝
<br>
- Being a huge fan of documentation of what I do I've decided document all the questions I solve for future revision purposes.
- This will also be a way to stay consistent with my coding and motivate me to keep going every day.
- This is a public repo so this can be used as a solution book to the good questions since I'm going to solve only good curated questions for now.
- Hoping I can keep up the pace and go over 1000 leetcode submissions in 2022.
